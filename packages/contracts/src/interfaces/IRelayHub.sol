 *
 * @notice The RelayHub also handles all the related financial records and hold the balances of participants.
 * The Paymasters keep their Ether deposited in the `RelayHub` in order to pay for the `RelayRequest`s that thay choose
 * to pay for, and Relay Servers keep their earned Ether in the `RelayHub` until they choose to `withdraw()`
 *
 * @notice The RelayHub on each supported network only needs a single instance and there is usually no need for dApp
 * developers or Relay Server operators to redeploy, reimplement, modify or override the `RelayHub`.
